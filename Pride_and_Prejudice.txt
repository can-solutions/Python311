ABSTRACT
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) are a super-
family of enzymes responsible for the faithful trans-
lation of the genetic code and have lately become aprominent target for synthetic biologists. Our large-
scale analysis of >2500 prokaryotic genomes reveals
the complex evolutionary history of these enzymesand their paralogs, in which horizontal gene trans-
fer played an important role. These results show that
a widespread belief in the evolutionary stability ofthis superfamily is misconceived. Although AlaRS,
GlyRS, LeuRS, IleRS, ValRS are the most stable mem-
bers of the family, GluRS, LysRS and CysRS oftenhave paralogs, whereas AsnRS, GlnRS, PylRS and
SepRS are often absent from many genomes. In the
course of this analysis, highly conserved protein mo-tifs and domains within each of the AARS loci were
identiﬁed and used to build a web-based computa-
tional tool for the genome-wide detection of AARS
coding sequences. This is based on hidden Markov
models (HMMs) and is available together with a cog-nate database that may be used for speciﬁc analyses.
The bioinformatics tools that we have developed may
also help to identify new antibiotic agents and targetsusing these essential enzymes. These tools also may
help to identify organisms with alternative pathways
that are involved in maintaining the ﬁdelity of the ge-netic code.
INTRODUCTION
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARSs) are very ancient
house-keeping enzymes that are present in all eukaryotes,archaea and bacteria. They mediate the accurate esterifica-
tion of amino acids (aa) to their cognate tRNAs and thusrepresent an essential superfamily of enzymes responsible
for the faithful translation of the genetic code. Apart from
the twenty AARSs that are responsible for the incorpo-ration of the twenty standard proteinogenic aa, two addi-
tional AARSs, PylRS and SepRS, are used by some or-
ganismsduringincorporationoftherareaapyrolysineandphosphoserine, respectively. AARSs are divided into two
non-homologous classes: class I and class II, mainly based
on distinct structural folds of their catalytic domains andonwhichsideofthetRNAacceptor-stemwillberecognized
by the enzyme ( 1,2). A common misconception is that the
genome of almost every organism contains a complete setof20AARS,eachbeingindividuallyresponsibleforcoding
theenzymethatchargesacognatetRNAwithoneofthe20
naturallyoccurringaa.Withtheever-increasingavailabilityof complete genome sequences, it is becoming evident that
geneduplication,horizontalgenetransfer,andgenelossare
much more frequent events among the AARSs than origi-nally thought.
The absence of an AARS-encoding gene from a genome
is possible because it does not necessarily correlate withthe absence of the corresponding essential biochemical
function. For example, the absence of glutaminyl-tRNA
synthetase (GlnRS) is rescued by a non-discriminatingglutamyl-tRNA synthetase (ND-GluRS) that can mis-
acylate Glu to a tRNA
Gln, which is then modified to Gln-
tRNAGlnby a tRNA-dependent amidotransferase ( 3). En-
zymatic modification of a mischarged aminoacyl-tRNA
(aa-tRNA) is documented for Asn, Gln, Cys, selenocys-
teine and formylmethionine ( 4–8). Therefore, cataloguing
all those cases where classical AARS genes are missing is

whichthecognateAARSismissing.Geneticcodedecoding
is a much more variable step than originally thought and
needs tobe quantified ( 9).
There are numerous reports of genomes with more than
one gene for the same AARS enzyme or even paralogous
fragments consisting of free-standing domains of AARSs
(e.g. catalytic-, anticodon-binding- and editing domains).These paralogs and paralog fragments have been the focus
of intense interest since their gene products exhibit diverse
functions outside translation. These range from tRNA-dependent aa synthesis, tRNA posttranscriptional mod-
ification, editing of misactivated aa and antibiotic resis-
tanceinbacteria,tomolecularhubswithinessentialsignal-ing pathways that regulate tumorigenesis in humans ( 10–
16).Evolutionaryanalyseshavehighlightedtheimportance
of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the evolution of theAARS family ( 17) and it has been found that this is of-
ten linked to antibiotic resistance, especially in microbes
(11,18–21).ThefactthatbacterialAARSsdonotoften( 22)
participateincomplexprotein-proteininteractionsandthat
they are frequently compatible with tRNAs from phyloge-neticallydistantorganismssuggeststhattheyarefrequently
functional (andhence selectable)followingHGT.
Many microorganisms have evolved low molecular
weight toxins that target these essential enzymes in other
microorganisms. Such toxins have already been identified
forAlaRS,AspRS,AsnRS,IleRS,LeuRS,LysRS,MetRS,ProRS, SerRS, ThrRS, TyrRS, TrpRs, PheRS ( 11,23).Cor-
respondingly, the microorganisms under attack either ac-
quirelow-levelresistance viapointmutationstothetargeted
AARS, or they acquire a resistant AARS paralog from
other organisms viaHGT (24,25). The most prominent ex-
ample of these toxins is mupirocin ( 13), a natural antibi-
oticthathasbeencommercialized. Pseudomonasfluorescens
NCIMB10586hasalargegeneclusterthatcontainsseveral
polyketidesynthasegenesandisresponsiblefortheproduc-tionofpseudomonicacid(otherwiseknownasmupirocin),
a natural compound that targets /inhibits IleRS. Interest-
ingly,withinthatcluster,thereexistsadivergentmupirocin-resistantIleRSparalog(designatedasmupA)inadditionto
the native, mupirocin-sensitive, IleRS. Therefore, both the
toxin and the antidote are in the same gene cluster ( 25,26).
The discovery that divergent AARS-paralogs confer resis-
tancetonaturalAARS-inhibitorshasbeendocumentedfor
MetRS, TrpRS, IleRS and SerRS paralogs; for a thoroughreview see ( 11,27). Thus, the detection of AARS paralogs
may lead to the discovery of new antibiotics that are ei-
therencodedasageneclusterinthevicinityoftheparalog,or somewhere else in the genome. Furthermore, potential
natural AARS inhibitors may be identified by comparative
genomics between closely related strains, where one of the
strains has an AARS duplicate (and may also have the in-
hibitor gene) whereas the other strains lack the AARS du-plicate (andthe inhibitor).
The manipulation and extension of the genetic code is
considered a cornerstone of synthetic biology and biotech-nology. In particular, the charging of certain tRNAs with
unnatural aa is crucial for both the construction of safe
GMOs and the engineering of enzymes with novel proper-ties(28–31).Towardthisgoal,itisimportanttounderstand
how the specificity of AARSs for aa and tRNAs is deter-mined.Therefore,theunbiaseddetectionofconservedmo-
tifs that characterize each specific AARS enzyme is a pre-
requisite for future manipulation and rational site-directed
mutagenesis studies.
The goal of our study was 5-fold: (i) to identify, in an
unbiasedmanner,highlyconservedmotifsanddomainsfor
eachAARS,(ii)todevelopanovelandsensitiveweb-basedcomputational tool (based on these motifs and domains)
that is capable of identifying orthologs and paralogs, or
evendivergentfragmentsofAARSenzymes,fromallking-doms of life and on a genome-wide scale, (iii) to analyze
more than 2500 prokaryotic genomes in order to provide
the first thorough and comprehensive evolutionary analy-sis of AARS genes and their paralogs, (iv) to organize and
storealltheaboveinformationinawell-organizeddatabase
tomakeitpubliclyaccessibleforstudiesofalternativepath-
ways or new antibiotics and (v) to identify potential candi-
datesfor AARS inhibitors /antibiotics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All annotated eukaryotic, prokaryotic and organel-
lar AARS sequences (11 984) were retrieved from theUniprot /Swissprot database ( 32). Redundancy was filtered
out at the 95% and 70% sequence similarity level with
the BlastClust software, resulting in non-redundant sets
of 7517 and 3276 AARS sequences, respectively. 2588
complete prokaryotic proteomes were downloaded fromthe NCBI ftp server with their sequences in fasta format
and their corresponding coordination ptt files for each
gene.
Conserved motifs were identified in each AARS enzyme
using the MEME software ( 33). It has been suggested by
previous analyses of this superfamily that domain archi-tecture is a good marker for phylogenetic reconstruction
(21). In general, domain emergence is very ancient, but
domain re-arrangements are a very common phenomenon(34–37). Custom-made HMM generation and scanning
was performed with the HMMER software ( 38). Multi-
ple alignments were performed with the Muscle software(39) whereas distance-based BioNJ phylogenetic analysis
wasperformedwiththeSeaviewsoftware( 40).Treedynwas
used for phylogenetic tree visualization ( 41) and integra-
tion of phylogenetic trees together with MEME-motif ar-
chitecturewasperformedinhtmlpagesbyusingJavascript.
All data handling was performed with custom-made Perlscripts. Smith-Waterman pairwise alignment and protein
similaritycalculationforpairsofhomologswithinthesame
genomewereestimatedwiththeEMBOSSWaterprogram.
ConstructionofHMMsofconservedcore-catalytic,edit-
ing and tRNA-binding domains was based on integration
of information from many sources, such as manual in-spection of alignments, MEME-motif architecture, expert
knowledgefromliterature( 20,21),domaincharacterization

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Discoveryof highly conserved motifs ineachAARSclass
Initially, 3276 Swissprot annotated AARS protein se-
quences (redundancy filtered at the 70% sequence similar-ity level) from each of the two classes (1739 in class I and
1537 in class II) were analyzed with the MEME software,
in order to identify shared conserved motifs within each ofthe two non-homologous classes. It is already well estab-
lished that class I contains a Rossman fold with the two
characteristic HIGH and a KMSKS conserved signatures,
whereas class II contains three other conserved motifs ( 1).
Our MEME analysis identified successfully the HIGH andKMSKS motifs in 98% (1708 /1739) and 80% (1394 /1739)
of the Swissprot class I proteins respectively. It also identi-
fied motifs 1, 2 and 3 in 59% (901 /1537), 73% (1121 /1537)
and 70% (1069 /1537) of the Swissprot class II proteins re-
spectively. The reason is that these three motifs and espe-
cially motif 1 are not so strongly conserved in all class IIAARSs.Interestingly,forthefirsttime,afourthmotif,des-
ignatedasmotif2B,duetoitsC-terminalproximitytomo-
tif2wasalsoidentifiedin73%(1124 /1537)oftheSwissprot
annotatedclassIIproteins.Figure 1andSupplementaryfile
1 summarizes the findings and the logos of the conserved
motifs in each of the AARS classes. From these logos, it isevident that they are very short and dependent on only a
few aa. When the MEME algorithm analyzes homologs of
thetwoAARSclassesitiscapableofidentifyingtheseveryshort motifs that are highly enriched in each class of this
super-family. Nevertheless, profile Hidden Markov models
based on these very short motifs have very limited detec-tion power, when it comes to proteome-wide scanning of
many diverse non-homologous families. Therefore, detec-
tion of AARS homologs based solely on these highly con-served, but very short motifs, is problematic. Another ap-
proachisneeded,whereaseriesofhighlyconservedmotifs
areusedattheenzymelevel(i.e.conservedwithinthatpar-ticular AARS enzyme),rather than at theclass level.
Discovery of conserved motifs in each AARS enzyme and
phylogenetic analyses
Foreachofthe20AARSenzymes,aswellasforPylRSand
SepRS, the corresponding Swissprot annotated protein se-quences (redundancy filtered at the 95% sequence similar-
ity level) were analyzed with the MEME software in order
to identify shared conserved motifs. The identification andarchitecture of MEME-motifs allowed us to separate each
enzymegrouptoitsdistinctphylogeneticsubgroups.Inad-
dition, it provided a better understanding of the degree ofdiversificationofeachorthologandveryimportantly,ofthe
various paralogs or paralog fragments. Towards this goal,
MEME was run with a parameter set that aimed to iden-tify 10 motifs for each AARS enzyme, except Asp–Asn–
AARS and Glu–Gln–AARS enzymes, where MEME was
setto identify20 motifs.
Based on the number and sequence-regions of identified
motifs that were present in all protein sequences of a cer-tain enzyme (that ranged between 2 and 10 motifs), BioNJ
phylogenetic trees were constructed for each enzyme and
the trees were visualized with the Treedyn software. More
specifically, the sequence regions of the motifs that werecommon in all sequences were concatenated for each se-
quence, and then the concatenated motif sequences were
used to build a tree. Next, a tree for a certain enzyme wasintegrated with the MEME-motif architecture of each se-
quence (in that tree) in html pages, using Javascript. Based
on the phylogenetic tree and the motif architecture, when-ever applicable, phylogenetic subgroups were identified by
manual inspection within a certain enzyme. Each of these
subgroups underwent another round of MEME-motif dis-covery,againusingaparametersetof10motifsandsubse-
quentphylogeneticanalysisusingonlythesharedmotifsof

quences. In this new round, the 386 sequences of subgroup1 again underwent MEME-motif discovery with a param-
eter set of 10 motifs. This time, eight motifs were identified
thatwerecommoninallthe386sequencesofthissubgroup.Basedonthese8motifsthattogethercomprised241amino

database). The same pipeline was implemented for the 114sequencesofProRSsubgroup2.Thistime,ninemotifswere
identifiedthatwerecommoninallthe114sequencesofthis

performed specifically for the 114 sequences. The new tree
was integrated with the new motif architecture and visual-ized with Treedyn and Javascript in HTML (see the other
ProRS treeinthe database).
For all the Uniprot AARS enzymes that were used for
training, the resulting phylogenetic trees together with thecorresponding motifs and motif architectures are availableinhtmlformatinthewebsite( http://bioinf.bio.uth.gr/aars ).
The above analyses resulted in 33 different phylogenetic
trees for 22 aaRS enzymes. This is because an AARS en-zymemayneedtobebrokentotwoormoresub-groups,so,
for each subgroup there exists a new tree and meme motif
architecture. The members of each kingdom (bacteria, ar-chaea, eukaryotes) aredistinguished bydifferentcolors.

For each of the 10 motifs of every phylogenetic group or
subgroup, we extracted the motif-sequences from all mem-
bers of that subgroup and performed multiple sequencealignment with the MUSCLE algorithm ( 39). Next, each
of these alignments was used to build a HMM with the
HMMER software ( 38). In total, 330 HMMs were con-
structed for their corresponding MEME-motifs. All anno-
tated AARS from Swissprot were scanned with these 330
HMMs using the HMMER software. The output file wasfilteredwithacustom-madeperlscriptthatassignedaquery
proteintoacertainAARSenzyme,basedonmajorityrule.
More specifically, if two hmms from two different enzymeswere hitting a certain protein region and their coordinates
wereoverlapping,thehmmwiththebestbitscorewouldbe
kept. In this way, hmms from different enzymes may com-pete for the same protein region. Finally, the enzyme that
hadthemosthmmsfoundintheproteinwouldberetained
as the best assignment. By applying a minimum cut-off oftwoorfivemotifs,theresultinghmmsandthemajorityrule
filtersappliedresultedin99.9%and99.8%correctlocusas-
signment respectively (see supplementary file 1: Swissprotevaluation).Thisprotocolhadhighprecision.Therefore,al-
though a cut-off of five motifs is stringent, its performance
is very satisfactory. This modular approach of individual
MEME-motifsisveryrobusttodomainre-arrangementsor
largeinsertionsthatmayhinderdetectionwithothermeth-ods. The principle applied in this analysis is similar to the
PRINTS database ( 47).
Despite all this, a small number of distant AARS par-
alogs, such as HisZcould not be detected by the MEME-motif approach. To overcome this problem, an additional
set of highly sensitive HMMs was developed, that was
based on the whole catalytic domain (sometimes includingan insertion domain). Again, all non-redundant annotated
AARSsequenceswereusedfortheconstructionofcatalytic
HMMs for each AARS enzyme, taking into account theevolutionary sub-groups within each AARS. In addition,
HMMs for editing and tRNA binding domains were cre-
ated. Again, this set of catalytic domain HMMs for eachlocuscouldcorrectlyidentify99.9%ofSwissprotannotated
AARSproteins.Furthermore,distantAARSparalogsthat
could not be detected by the MEME-motif approach werenowdetected.Only9 /883SwissprotannotatedGluRSwere

Development of a database and web-based detection tool
In order to investigate the AARS evolutionary pro-
file of prokaryotes, the newly developed computational
tool /pipelinewasusedtoanalyze ∼8millionproteinsfrom
2588 prokaryotic proteomes, that were downloaded fromNCBI. Proteins were first scanned by the highly sensitive,
but not so highly specific, catalytic domain HMMs, result-
ing in 56 469 protein hits. Next, these hits were further
scannedbythehighlyspecificmeme-motifs,applyingaless
stringent cutoff of two motifs and thus resulting in 52 595

The results from the large-scale NCBI prokaryotic
proteome-wide scanning have been organized and saved in
a MySQL database ( bioinf.bio.uth.gr/aars ). The user may
query, in the database, only those proteins (NCBI proteinaccessions)whosenumberofAARS-specificmotifsexceeds

where the number of genes /paralogs for each AARS en-
zyme are displayed for each genome or a filtered /selected
set of genomes. User selection of a certain protein also dis-

opedspecifically forAARSs was constructedin2001 ( 48).
Aweb-basedAARSmotif /domaindetectiontoolisalso
integratedintothedatabase,wheretheusermayuploadse-quences in FASTA format for scanning. Such a tool is use-
fulnotonlyforannotatingtheAARSsuperfamilyinanew
genome (prokaryotic or even eukaryotic), but also for de-tecting paralog fragments or identifying genomes with al-
ternative pathways, by observing the absence of a partic-
ular type of AARS gene. Recently, there has been intenseinterest in identifying human AARS fragments, even those
that are catalytic nulls, because they seem to be involved
in diverse functions. Paralog fragments of AARSs repre-sented by appended domains and exhibiting various bio-
logical functions have been identified in recent years in al-
most all organisms. The new roles and diverse functions oftheAARSfragmentsor,insomecases,theirgeneduplicates
aremostlyrelatedtopathwaysoutsidetranslation,ranging
from editing and antibiotic resistance in bacteria to molec-ular hubs within essential signaling pathways that regulate
tumorigenesis in humans ( 15,28,49,50). The domain archi-
tecture of AARSs seems to be critical for conferring addi-tional functions; however, the exact repertoire of these do-
mains when they act intransstill remains elusive to a great
extent. Interestingly, it was recently shown that the manip-ulation of such domains revealed their direct involvement
in many metabolic networks that regulate essential cellular
processes ( 51).
A global overview of the evolutionary profile of prokaryotic
AARS
By analyzing 2588 prokaryotic proteomes, it was possible
to obtain a very comprehensive evolutionary profile of this
complexfamilythatplaysacentralroleinensuringfaithful
translation of the genetic code and also in natural toxin re-sistance. For many of the subsequent analyses, we applied
different criteria. In the first and more stringent criterion,
a gene was considered to be a member of an AARS en-zymeifitdisplayedatleast5outof10motifs.Ourprevious
evaluationanalysis,basedonSwissportannotatedAARSs,
showed that this cut-off was capable of capturing and cor-
rectly annotating 99.8% of the proteins. In a second (and
morerelaxed)criterion,agenewasconsideredtobeamem-ber of an AARS locus if it had at least 2 out of 10 mo-
tifs. In an even more relaxed criterion, due to the failure
of MEME-motifs to capture some very distant homologs,
such asHisZ, a gene was considered to be a member of
an AARS enzyme if it was detected by the HMM of a cat-
alytic domain. In this way,the moredistantparalogs could
becapturedaswell.TheperformanceoftheMEME-motifs(withcut-offtwoandfive)andthecatalyticdomainHMMs
is shown in supplementary file1.
The catalytic domains have a very similar performance
to that of the MEME-motifs with cut-off two, except for
ProRS and HisRS. The same conclusions regarding the
reduced detection power of MEME-motifs, but only forProRS and HisRS distant homologs are also drawn from
the analysis of the NCBI proteomes (see Table 1). In the
case of HisRS, the catalytic domain HMMs are capable ofcapturingthe HisZparalogsthatareknowntolackaminoa-
cylation activity ( 16) whereas the MEME-motifs could not
capture the vast majority of such paralogs. NCBI has an-
notated the majority of HisZparalogs as ATP phospho-
ribosyltransferases. In the case of ProRS, the catalytic do-mainHMMsarecapableofcapturingthe ybaK /ebsC /ProX
proteins that constitute an editing domain of one ProRS
sub-groupthatmayfunctionin
trans,whereastheMEME-
motifs could not capture the vast majority of the members
of this sub-group, probably because the motifs were situ-
atedinthecatalyticcore.VisualinspectionoftheNCBIan-notationofdetectedproteinsbythethreecriteria(catalytic
domainHMMonly,MEME-motifcutoff,twoandMEME-
motifcutofffive)revealedthat93.2%(52662 /56531),98.7%
(51975 /52653) and 99.1% (49380 /49846) of detected pro-
teins respectively were clearly annotated as tRNA syn-
thetases or as a known paralog. This is a very strong in-dication that the MEME-motif detection methods are not
onlyvery sensitive,butalso veryspecific.
DistributionofAARSgeneswithingenomesreflectstheevo-
lution of the geneticcode
Although it is a common belief that most prokaryotic
genomes have 20 AARS genes, our large-scale analysisclearly showed that this is not the case. Rather, the most
frequent number of AARS genes in a prokaryotic genome
is 19, although there also exist many genomes with 20AARS, albeit less frequently. A distribution of the num-
ber of AARS genes per genome is shown in Figure 2.
This reduced number is mostly due to the frequent ab-sence of GlnRS (62% of scanned genomes; see Table 1).
This finding is in accordance with an evolutionary sce-
nario where GlnRS emerged later in evolution in the eu-karyotic lineage viaduplication of GluRS and moved to
bacteriaviaHGT (17,52,53). In all prokaryotes missing
GlnRS, Gln incorporation is mediated viaa transamida-
tion pathway ( 3,54). Gamma-Proteobacteria were consid-
eredastheGlnRSentry-pointinthebacterialworld.Byan-
alyzing the present distribution of GlnRS in the sequencedgenomes and comparing it to an expected by-chance sce-
nario, the most enriched phylogenetic lineage for GlnRs is
indeed Proteobacterial (hypergeometric test: 1.5e–169). In
addition, no Gln-GltxRS was detected in the analyzed Ar-
chaeal genomes.

this case, by analyzing the present distribution of AsnRS
in the 2588 sequenced genomes and comparing it to an ex-pected by-chance scenario, the most enriched phylogenetic
lineageforAsnRs originates amongtheFirmicutes (hyper-
geometric test:2.7e-116).
Concerning TrpRS and TyrRS, it has been suggested
(basedonstructuralalignments)thatthemoreancientgene
isthatforTyrRSwhereasthatforTrpRSemergedbydupli-cation in the archaeal lineage and later moved to bacteria
via HGT ( 55). Indeed, this scenario is also supported by
our evolutionary profile, but only for a cut-off of five mo-tifs,where16%ofprokaryotesaremissingaTrpRSwhereas
only 1.5% seem to be missing a TyrRS. Interestingly, onlyfor a cut-off of five motifs, HisRS, is missing from 9%
of studied genomes. Histidine is also considered a rather
‘young’aa.Theorderthatanaaenteredthegeneticcode,as
suggested by the co-evolution code theory, is in very goodagreementwithourevolutionaryprofileofAARSenzymes,
but only for a cut-off of five motifs, as shown in Table 1
(56,57).
Intriguingly, there seem to be some broad correlations
between the evolutionary age and the reactivity of aa and
the deletion /duplication frequency of their corresponding
AARSs.AminoacidssuchasArg,Cys,Met,Gln,Tyr,Trp,
His, Asn, Phe have been proposed to be relatively later ad-
ditions to the genetic code ( 58). For a strict cut-off of five
MEME-motifs, the AARSs that esterify these ‘younger’ aa
(with the exception of Cys and Tyr) also tend to be com-
pletely absent from prokaryotic genomes more frequentlycompared to the group of AARSs that esterify the older
aa. It is also very interesting that many of the AARSs that

Val, Ala, Gly) to tRNAs seem to be very stable (only onecopy of the gene per genome) in their evolutionary profile.
Takentogether,ourfindingssupportthenotionsthatamino
acid emergence mirrors genetic code structure, with tRNAand AARS assignments evolving consequently.
The presence of paralogs is very frequent
To ensure a conservative approach, the results of this sec-
tion are based on a cut-off of five motifs, unless stated oth-
erwise. This analysis revealed that 40–61% (for five motifsand for two motifs) of scanned genomes had at least one
AARS paralog detected.
ThehighestnumberofAARSgenesdetectedinagenome
is 29 inKetasatospora setae and 28 in Bacillus cereus .I n
general, the Bacillus genus had several genomes with a
highnumberofAARSgenes /paralogs.Twenty-twopercent
(581 /2588) and 3% (85 /2588) of scanned NCBI genomes
had≥21and ≥23AARSs,respectively.Moreover,thegroup
of genomes with ≥23 AARSs was enriched for Firmicutes
(64% instead of 21% background; hypergeometric test: 5e–
17).Ontheotherhand, Nasuiadeltocephalinicola str.NAS-
ALF was the genome with the lowest number (only oneLeuRS for a cutoff of five motifs and five genes for a cut-
offoftwomotifs)ofAARSgenesdetected.Thisisprobably
due to the endosymbiotic lifestyle of the smallest prokary-otic genome yet sequenced (169 genes in total) ( 59). If one
considers that 20 is the expected number of AARS genes
that should be found in a genome, our analysis shows that59% (1531 /2588) of the genomes scanned had less than
that number, whereas 22% had more than 20 AARS genes.
In terms of paralogs, the most extreme case was of Ki-
tasatosporasetae withfourallelesfortheSerRSgene.Each
ofthefourgeneshadsevenormoremotifsandwereallan-
notated as SerRS by NCBI. Similarly, there were three al-
leles of the same gene for AspRS, CysRS, GluRS, LeuRS,
LysRS, ThrRS and ValRS in various species.LysRS is an interesting case, because this AARS can
either be from class I or class II ( 60). A total of 2143
genomeshadonlyclassIILysRS,whereas377genomeshad
only class I LysRS. Thirty nine genomes (mostly Bacillus
thuringiensis andBacilluscereus strainsandmembersofthe
Streptomyces genus)hadgenesfrombothclasses.Itismore
common to have a paralogous gene of the same class (218
genomeswithclass-IILysparalogs;onlyonecaseofapar-
aloginclassI)insteadofhavinggenesfromthetwoclasses
(39 cases).
One crucial question for understanding the molecular
mechanisms of evolution of AARS paralogs found within
thesamegenome,iswhethertheyresultfromeithergenedu-plicationorHGT.Towardthisgoal,abasicassumptionwas
made that if two homologs of the same enzyme have very
high protein sequence similarity, then they are most prob-ably the result of a recent gene duplication. On the other
hand, if two homologs have rather low similarity, then ei-
thertheyaretheresultofHGTorrepresentsurvivorsfromaveryoldgeneduplicationeventthatwassoonfollowedby
rapid divergence.Byusing1751pairs ofhomologs,thedis-
tribution of the percentage of protein similarity was calcu-lated (shown in supplementary file 1: Paralog
similarities).
From the graph, it is evident that (based on the above as-
sumptions) <10% of homologous pairs are the result of a
recentgeneduplicationwithinthegenome.Thiscalculation
isinaccordancewithpreviouslarge-scaleanalysesonother
proteinfamilies,whereHGTinsteadofintra-chromosomalgene duplication is considered the main driving force be-
hind protein family expansion in prokaryotes with an esti-
mated contribution of 88–98% ( 61). Furthermore, a previ-
ous analysis with much less genomic data available at that
time (1999) also supported HGT as a driving force in the
early evolution of this family ( 21). On average, two ho-
mologs of the same AARS enzyme in a genome had 57%
sequence similarity. The 60% of analyzed genomes had no
evidence of paralog presence in any AARS at all. More-
over, the vast majority of AARSs were detected in bacte-

Apparently, HGT plays a significant role in the expansionof AARS paralogs, but complex evolutionary scenarios in-
cludinggeneduplicationsfollowedbyrapiddivergence,do-
main shuffling and gene loss should also be considered, asin thecase of the bonafide AARSs ( 2,19,62,63)
It is tempting to speculate that the extended presence of
paralogs is mainly driven by resistance to inhibitors, as forexample in the case of bacterial MprF proteins that are
fusedtoLysRSs( 64).Nevertheless,theintegrationofavail-
able knowledge about known AARS paralogs with such
resistance, together with the extent of paralog presence in
prokaryotic genomes, as shown in Table 1, does not pro-
vide strong support for such a claim. An alternative ex-
planation is that these paralogs are involved in other bio-
chemical functions ( 65), many of them as yet unknown, in
accordance with various observations where AARSs form
complexes with other types of proteins, thus participating
in other functions beyond translation ( 22,66). It is also in-
triguing that atypical AARS paralogs have been identified
asparticipatinginpeptideformation viathenon-ribosomal
peptide synthesis mechanism ( 67). In principle, manual in-
spection of domain and MEME-motif architecture by our
computationaltoolsshouldprovidebetterinsightonwhich
is thetypical and whichis thediverse AARS allele.
Computational detection of potential natural AARS in-
hibitors
Recently, there has been a growing concern that misuse of
antibiotics is triggering the emergence of resistant strainsthat could eventually lead to a post-antibiotic world ( 68).
Therefore, the discovery of new antibiotics, although ne-
glected for some time, is now back in focus. AARSs havedrawn considerableattentionduringrecentyearsastargets
of newantibacterial inhibitors.
Mupirocin is the product of a cluster of multimodu-
lar polyketide synthetases in Pseudomonas fluorescens and
is an inhibitor of the cognate IleRS, acting as an an-
tibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus .
The modified IleRS paralog mupA that lies within the
mupirocinbiosyntheticcluster(in P.fluorescens )confersre-
sistancetomupirocinbycomplementingthefunctionofthemupirocin-inhibited cognate IleRS, thus acting as an anti-
dote (26,69). To nullify the mupirocin inhibitor, S. aureus
has evolved another paralog, mupB ( 69). In order to iden-
tifyotherpotentialantibioticclusters,welookedforAARS
paralogs /xenologsthathavewithintheirvicinity( ±10geneneighbors) NCBI-annotated polyketide synthetase genes.
The results of this in silico genomic search are summa-
r i z e di nT a b l e 2and need to be verified experimentally in
the future. The mupirocin cluster was not detected because
thewhole-genomesequenceof P.fluorescens strainwasnot
availableforscanninginNCBI.Withthecostofsequencingbeing reduced, very soon, metagenomic approaches will be

tationaltoolsfortherapidandsensitivedetectionofAARS

plishedbyusingautomaticandunbiaseddetectionofshort

forthetranslationofthegeneticcode––theacylationoftR-
NAs with their cognate amino acids. Furthermore, it ap-pears that the presence of more than one AARS homolog
of the same enzyme is usually the result of horizontal gene
transfer or gene duplication followed by rapid divergence,most probably linked to alternative biochemical functions,
although resistance towards AARS-targeting toxins from
otherbacteriacannot be excluded.
